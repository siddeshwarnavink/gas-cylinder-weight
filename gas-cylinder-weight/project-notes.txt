Assumptions:
1. All images from the camera are the same dimensions & ratio.
2. Considering only household cylinder.
3. All text height are the same.

What we need to do: Get the weight of the cylinder.

Idea #1 - Colour crop:
1. Get all white colour from the image
2. identity the text using rotation algorithm.

Idea #2 - Circular crop
1. turn the image into a circle.
[loop start]
2. scan around the circumfarance of the circle with a cursor of height=height of text
3. crop down the image to height of the text.
[loop end]
